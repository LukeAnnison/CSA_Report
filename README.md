# CSA Deep Research Report: Atomic Note Extraction Process

This README tracks the process of digesting the long CSA Deep Research Report into atomic notes. The goal is to create comprehensive, self-contained notes for each topic, ensuring the content is sliced into concise but complete units.

## Workflow
1. **Chunk Selection**: Work through the source files (starting with `README.md`), processing a manageable chunk at a time (by line range, section, or bullet).
2. **Atomic Note Proposal**: For each chunk, propose atomic note titles and brief descriptions.
3. **Approval & Edit**: Review, approve, or adjust the proposed breakdown.
4. **Note Creation**: For each atomic note, create a new, standalone markdown file or section. Do not edit existing notes; if a topic overlaps, cross-reference or duplicate content as needed for clarity and completeness.
5. **Progress Tracking**: Mark each processed chunk below.
6. **Continue**: Repeat until the entire report is digested.

**Note:** The end result will be a comprehensive, segmented set of atomic notes covering the entire report, with no gaps or excessive overlap. Cross-referencing and duplication are allowed to ensure each note is self-contained and clear.

## Instructions
- Use this checklist to track which sections have been processed.
- For each chunk, create atomic notes as separate markdown files or sections.
- Notes should be comprehensive for their topic, but not overly broad—aim for clarity and completeness.
- If a chunk is too large, further subdivide as needed.
- Mark each item as complete when finished.
