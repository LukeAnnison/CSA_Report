# Regulatory Framework: FCA's New Rules vs. MiFID II (UK, US, EU)

MiFID II Unbundling and Its Challenges: Under MiFID II (effective 2018), EU and UK asset managers were required to "unbundle" research payments from execution commissions, meaning research had to be paid via the manager's own funds or a dedicated Research Payment Account (RPA) rather than through trading commissions. This reform aimed to improve cost transparency for investors but created friction with other jurisdictions, notably the US, where bundled "soft dollar" arrangements under Section 28(e) remained common. Many EU/UK managers opted to pay for research out of their own P&L instead of using complex RPA mechanisms, which led to a decline in research budgets and coverage, especially for small-cap stocks. In the US, brokers faced legal barriers to accepting direct cash for research unless they registered as advisers. A temporary SEC no-action letter (2017–2023) had allowed US broker-dealers to receive unbundled research payments from MiFID-affected managers without being deemed investment advisers, but that relief expired in July 2023. This left a transatlantic mismatch: UK/EU managers were barred from paying via trading commissions, while US brokers were reluctant or unable to provide research for free or via hard dollars without regulatory risk.

FCA Policy Change (PS24/9 – "Payment Optionality for Investment Research"): In response to these issues and a broad UK government review of investment research in 2023, the FCA introduced a new "joint payment" option effective 1 August 2024. This is essentially a reintroduction of CSA-style bundling in the UK, but with guardrails to preserve transparency. The FCA explicitly does not permit a full return to pre-MiFID bundling – instead, the new rules require a separately identifiable research charge within a bundled commission. In practice, this mirrors a classic CSA: when an asset manager trades with a broker, part of the commission can be designated for research (the "research charge") and the rest for execution. Crucially, the research component must be identified and managed separately, preventing the "opacity of prices" that full bundling would create. As the FCA notes, fully bundled arrangements hide the cost of research and impede price comparison, whereas CSA-like arrangements maintain discipline and transparency.

Rationale for the UK's CSA Revival: The FCA's goals are to boost UK competitiveness and research coverage while maintaining investor protection. By adding this third payment option (alongside paying from P&L or via RPA), the FCA hopes to promote competition among asset managers (especially helping smaller managers who found RPAs burdensome) and improve international competitiveness of UK firms by aligning with practices in the US and elsewhere. In its policy statement, the FCA acknowledged that CSA-type mechanisms are a "common operating practice and a frequent firm choice" globally, even if not mandated by regulation. The change is partly aimed at resolving the US-UK divide: UK managers can now pay US broker-dealers for research using trading commissions, which was difficult after the SEC's no-action relief ended. This should positively impact US and global brokers, allowing UK buy-sides to once again obtain research from US firms without regulatory workaround. More broadly, UK regulators hope that easier funding of research will increase the quantity and quality of analyst research, particularly for UK small and mid-cap companies, thereby improving liquidity and capital markets activity.

Scope and Jurisdictional Differences: It's important to note jurisdictional nuances:

- **UK:** The new joint-payment/CSA option is now permitted for MiFID investment firms (e.g. UK investment managers) as of Aug 2024, with guardrails such as budgeting, client disclosure, and "reasonable" charges to prevent misuse. Initially, certain UK fund management entities (UCITS managers, AIFMs) are excluded until rules are aligned in late 2024. UK brokers can offer CSA arrangements, but are not compelled to – the FCA opted not to force all brokers to accept joint payments, treating it as a commercial decision between research buyers and sellers. Notably, the FCA removed prior inducement rule exemptions for small-cap research as minor non-monetary benefits (e.g. the UK's 2022 allowance for <£200m cap issuers) because the new framework supersedes it.
- **EU:** In the EU, MiFID II unbundling remains largely in force. The EU made limited concessions – since 2021 research on small/mid-cap issuers (market cap ≤ €1 billion) can be provided bundled or free as a minor non-monetary benefit, and certain fixed-income research was exempted. However, full CSA-style bundling for general equity research is still not allowed unless using an RPA structure. EU asset managers must either pay from P&L or use RPAs (which function similarly to CSAs but with stricter budgeting and client agreement). This means a UK sell-side firm dealing with EU-based buy-side clients must still accommodate MiFID II rules – e.g. an EU asset manager cannot simply opt into the UK's new joint payment model unless EU rules change. In practice, a UK broker can execute trades for an EU manager, but that manager would need to fund research via an RPA or their own resources to remain compliant (the CSA portion would effectively be an RPA charge in EU context). The regulatory divergence could lead to buy-side behavioral differences: UK managers may embrace CSAs again for efficiency, while EU managers might continue to minimize external research spend or use RPAs selectively. Sell-side firms will need to segregate these approaches.
- **US:** The US never adopted MiFID-style unbundling for domestic business. Soft dollar arrangements under Section 28(e) remain legal and common, meaning US asset managers routinely use commission dollars to pay for research. A US-based manager can participate in CSAs (often called Client Commission Arrangements, CCAs, in the US) without regulatory barriers. For a UK sell-side firm's U.S. operations, the main consideration is the SEC's rule that brokers receiving hard-dollar payments for research may need to register as investment advisers. With the UK now allowing bundled payments again, US brokers and UK brokers can more easily share commissions: a UK manager's trades can fund research at a US broker under the Section 28(e) safe harbor. In summary, US buy-side behavior has long been CSA-friendly, and the UK's new rules realign with that, whereas EU buy-sides remain constrained. Firms operating across UK, US, and EU will need to set policy on who can pay via CSA versus who needs an RPA or separate billing, depending on client locale and regulatory status. This may entail parallel systems: e.g. a UK asset management arm using CSAs, an EU arm sticking to unbundled payments – and coordinating research access accordingly.

Investor Protection and Guardrails: The FCA's CSA revival comes with conditions to protect end-investors and maintain MiFID II's transparency benefits. Key guardrails include:

- **Budgeting & Accountability:** Managers must set research budgets (at a strategy, fund, or client group level) and regularly assess the research's value, preventing an unchecked "spend as you trade" mentality. If budgets are exceeded, disclosures to clients are required in a timely manner.
- **Client Cost Transparency:** Asset managers must disclose to their clients how research charges are incurred and the types of research providers paid (e.g. breakdown of independent vs non-independent providers). This ensures clients understand what they're paying for. (From the sell-side perspective, brokers might need to assist managers by providing data on commissions allocated to research).
- **Fair Allocation / No Inducement:** Rules ensure managers allocate research costs fairly among client accounts (no one client subsidizing others' research), and that using CSAs doesn't create inducements – e.g. a broker cannot condition better execution on research bundling. The FCA explicitly notes that under a CSA, the executing broker cannot be sure the research portion will come back to itself. This uncertainty is by design – it prevents brokers from insisting that all commission be "stayed" for their own research (preserving competition among research providers).
- **No "Full Service Only" Requirement:** The FCA chose not to let sell-sides force bundled commissions. A buy-side retains the choice to trade on an execution-only basis if desired. Brokers also are not required to operate CSAs, but practically many will if clients demand. The FCA's stance is that whether to use bundled/CSA payments is a commercial negotiation between buy-side and sell-side. This implies sell-side firms like ours should be ready to support CSA workflows but also can accommodate clients who prefer other models.

Open Questions / Ambiguities: A few areas remain in flux:

- **EU Response:** It is uncertain if the EU will follow the UK's lead for broader CSA adoption. If EU rules remain strict, global asset managers may face complexity segmenting their research payment approaches. This could influence how much CSA business a UK broker can win from EU-based clients (a point to monitor as EU reviews MiFID II in coming years).
- **Adoption by Managers:** While the FCA provides the option, it's up to buy-side firms whether and when to use it. Some UK asset managers might stick to paying from P&L (especially large firms that have built that into their fees), while smaller managers might be quicker to revert to CSAs to conserve their own resources. Sell-side firms should gauge client interest – the actual uptake of CSAs will determine how much infrastructure is worthwhile.
- **Cross-Border Payments:** There is ambiguity on handling cross-border CSA flows, e.g. a UK manager directing CSA credits to an EU research provider. In theory, the UK manager can now do so, but the EU research provider (if not a broker) might encounter local issues (such as needing to register for inducements rules or VAT complications). Clarity on how different regulators view such arrangements (extra-territorially) will evolve.
- **Client Consent:** The FCA hinted that managers may need to consider client consent or notifications when switching to CSA payments (especially for retail clients). The exact expectations under the new Consumer Duty, for instance, are something buy-sides are figuring out. Sell-sides might get questions on this when setting up agreements.

In sum, the UK's regulatory framework now welcomes CSA-style commission bundling once again. A UK-based small-cap broker/research house should prepare to operate in a hybrid environment: supporting bundled commissions for UK and U.S. clientele under the new rules, while still accommodating unbundled or RPA-based payments for EU clients or any others who need them. The regulatory trend in the UK is clearly toward flexibility and pragmatism in research payments, aiming to revitalize research in the market without returning to the opaque old days.
