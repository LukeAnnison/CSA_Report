# Common Risks and Pain Points in CSA Implementation

Implementing a CSA program presents several risks and operational challenges that must be proactively managed:

## Client Allocation Decisions
- Clients may delay or fail to allocate CSA credits, leading to dormant balances and frustrated research providers.
- Encourage timely usage through communication and platform tools, but ultimate control rests with the client.

## Vendor Lock-in and Fit
- Risk of selecting a vendor that does not fully meet needs or becomes expensive over time.
- Negotiate contracts carefully and ensure access to raw data for contingency planning.

## Interdepartmental Coordination
- CSAs require collaboration across departments that may not typically work closely together.
- Clear documentation, training, and cultural alignment are key to avoiding misunderstandings.

## Early Vendor Discussion Points
- Integration and data quality, customization, implementation timeline, cost transparency, references, and product roadmap.
- Clarify the vendor's role in payment execution and support model.
