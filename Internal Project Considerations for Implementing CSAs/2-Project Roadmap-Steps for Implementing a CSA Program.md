# Project Roadmap: Steps for Implementing a CSA Program

A structured roadmap is essential for launching a successful CSA program. Key steps include:

## 1. Regulatory Analysis & Business Case
- Confirm legal feasibility and necessity (e.g., PS24/9 implications).
- Assess client demand and potential research revenue.
- Analyze competitive landscape.

## 2. Design Phase â€“ Model and Policies
- Decide on operational model (e.g., external payments, admin fees, research pricing, unused credits policy).
- Establish budgeting and disclosure processes.

## 3. Vendor Selection and Integration
- Evaluate vendors for CSA management (see separate note for criteria).
- Assess integration with execution, finance, and reporting systems.

## 4. Pilot Planning & Implementation
- Develop/configure system, migrate data, and conduct internal testing.
- Draft process manuals and train stakeholders.
- Communicate with clients about the new CSA option.

## 5. Pilot Execution
- Soft-launch with select clients, refine processes based on feedback.

## 6. Full Rollout
- Onboard all clients and research providers, update trade confirmations, and provide ongoing support.

## 7. Ongoing Management
- Regular reconciliation, audits, client budget monitoring, and feedback loops.
- Governance reporting to ensure compliance and continuous improvement.
