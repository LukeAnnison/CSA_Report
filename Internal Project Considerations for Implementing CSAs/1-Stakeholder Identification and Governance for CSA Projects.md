# Stakeholder Identification and Governance for CSA Projects

Implementing a Commission Sharing Arrangement (CSA) program requires the involvement of multiple internal stakeholders and robust governance structures to ensure success and compliance.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Research Department:** Responsible for producing research, pricing, and tracking client access. Provides input on research value and client discussions.
- **Sales & Trading:** Communicates CSA offerings to clients, negotiates commission allocations, and ensures correct trade tagging and execution. Front-line for client queries about CSA balances.
- **Compliance & Legal:** Interprets regulations, drafts internal policies and agreements, monitors eligible research payments, and ensures fair client treatment and disclosures.
- **Finance / Operations:** Manages CSA liabilities, reconciliations, payments to research providers, and financial risk. Coordinates audits and ensures accurate reporting.
- **IT Department:** Develops or integrates systems for CSA tracking, manages data feeds, security, and reporting capabilities.
- **Management (C-level/Business Heads):** Sets strategic goals, approves budgets, and oversees revenue recognition and client relationship strategy.

## Governance Structures
- **Steering Committee:** Cross-functional team overseeing project progress, budgets, controls, and client issues.
- **Research Payment Committee:** Ongoing body to monitor CSA operations, address budgets, controls, and client/provider issues.
