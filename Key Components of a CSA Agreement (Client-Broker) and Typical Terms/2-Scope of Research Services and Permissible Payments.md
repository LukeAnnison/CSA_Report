# Scope of Research Services and Permissible Payments

A key component of any CSA agreement is a clear definition of what constitutes 'research' and what payments are permissible under regulatory rules.

## Defining 'Research'
- Typically references regulatory definitions (e.g., FCA COBS 2.3B, Section 28(e) in the US).
- Includes advice, analyses, reports, and services that provide substantive insight or value to investment decisions.
- May explicitly exclude items such as market data, corporate access, travel, entertainment, and non-research services.

## Permissible Payments
- Only eligible research services can be paid for via CSA credits.
- Payments for non-research items are prohibited to avoid inducement risks and ensure compliance.
- The CSA ops team must vet new research providers and payment instructions to ensure only qualifying services are funded.

## Importance of Clarity
- Clear definitions protect both broker and client from regulatory breaches.
- Reduces risk of disputes or inadvertent inducements.
- Ensures the CSA is used strictly for its intended purpose: funding substantive investment research.
