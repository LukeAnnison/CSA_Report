# Core Structure and Purpose of a CSA Agreement

A Commission Sharing Arrangement (CSA) agreement is a legal contract between an asset manager (client) and a broker, establishing how trading commissions are split and used to pay for research services.

## Main Objectives
- **Transparency:** Clearly separates execution and research charges within trading commissions.
- **Flexibility:** Allows clients to direct research payments to multiple providers, not just the executing broker.
- **Compliance:** Ensures all payments align with regulatory requirements (e.g., MiFID II, FCA rules).

## Role in the Broker-Client Relationship
- Sets out the operational mechanics for accruing, holding, and paying out research credits.
- Clarifies that the broker only disburses credits upon client instruction and is not liable for payments absent those instructions.
- Provides a framework for fair allocation, audit rights, and dispute resolution.
