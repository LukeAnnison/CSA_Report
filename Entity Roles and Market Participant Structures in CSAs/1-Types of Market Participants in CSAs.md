# Types of Market Participants in CSAs

Commission Sharing Arrangements (CSAs) involve a network of financial market participants, each playing distinct roles in the research payment and execution value chain. The main types of entities include:

## 1. Full-Service Brokers
- Offer both trade execution and research services.
- Act as the primary counterparty for buy-side clients, executing trades and accumulating commission credits that can be allocated to research providers (including themselves or third parties).
- Must manage both the operational and compliance aspects of CSAs, including tracking credits, processing payments, and ensuring regulatory adherence.

## 2. Research-Only Firms
- Provide independent research but do not execute trades.
- Rely on brokers to receive CSA payments, often requiring registration as broker-dealers (especially in the US) or participation agreements with executing brokers.
- Are price-takers in CSA deals and depend on the efficiency and fairness of brokers to get paid.

## 3. Execution Specialists (DMA/Algo Providers)
- Focus on trade execution, often via Direct Market Access (DMA) or algorithmic trading platforms.
- Historically outside the CSA scope, but increasingly offer CSA services to attract institutional clients.
- May partner with research aggregators to facilitate research payments.

## 4. Buy-Side Asset Managers
- Initiate trades and direct commission allocations via CSAs.
- Responsible for budgeting, allocating, and instructing payments for research, ensuring compliance with client mandates and regulatory requirements.
- Must manage relationships with multiple brokers and research providers, often across jurisdictions.

Each participant's role is shaped by regulation, market structure, and client demand. Understanding these roles is foundational to navigating the CSA ecosystem.
