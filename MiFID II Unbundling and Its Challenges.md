# MiFID II Unbundling and Its Challenges

MiFID II, implemented in the EU and UK in 2018, required asset managers to "unbundle" research payments from execution commissions. This meant that research could no longer be paid for via trading commissions, but instead had to be funded either from the manager's own P&L or through a dedicated Research Payment Account (RPA).

**Key Points:**
- The reform aimed to improve cost transparency for investors by making research costs explicit and separate from trading costs.
- The unbundling created significant operational and compliance challenges for asset managers, who now had to set up and manage RPAs or absorb research costs directly.
- Many managers, especially in the UK and EU, opted to pay for research out of their own P&L rather than use the complex RPA mechanism.
- This shift led to a marked decline in research budgets across the industry, with a particularly severe impact on coverage of small-cap stocks. As research became more expensive and budgets shrank, many brokers reduced or eliminated small-cap research, leading to less market coverage and potentially lower liquidity for these stocks.
- The unbundling also created friction with other jurisdictions, notably the US, where bundled "soft dollar" arrangements remained common under Section 28(e).

**Summary:**
MiFID II's unbundling requirement fundamentally changed the economics and availability of investment research in the UK and EU, especially for small-cap companies. While it improved transparency, it also reduced research coverage and created cross-border regulatory mismatches.
