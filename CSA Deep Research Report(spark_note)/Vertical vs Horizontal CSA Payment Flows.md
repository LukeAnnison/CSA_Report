# Vertical vs. Horizontal CSA Payment Flows

CSAs support two main models for allocating research payments: vertical (internal) and horizontal (external).

**Vertical Linkage (Internal Research):**
- The executing broker also provides the research.
- The client's commission pot pays the broker's own research department, with the transfer identified as a research charge.
- This is straightforward, essentially an internal transfer from execution to research revenue.

**Horizontal Linkage (Third-Party Research):**
- The client trades with Broker A but wants to pay Research Firm B for research.
- Broker A acts as an aggregator, paying out credits to Firm B upon the client's instruction.
- Enables clients to mix and match execution and research providers, increasing flexibility and competition.

**Operational Implications:**
- Brokers must have participation agreements in place with external providers.
- Systems must handle both internal and external payments without double counting.

**Summary:**
Vertical flows are simpler, but horizontal flows are the hallmark of CSAs, allowing clients to direct research spend across the market.
