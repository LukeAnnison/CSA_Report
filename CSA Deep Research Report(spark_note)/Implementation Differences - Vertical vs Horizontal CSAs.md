# Implementation Differences: Vertical vs. Horizontal CSAs

Supporting vertical and horizontal CSAs involves distinct operational challenges and considerations.

**Vertical CSA (Internal Research):**
- Focuses on accounting segregation and internal transfer pricing for research services.
- Requires pricing of internal research offerings and monitoring client consumption to justify charges.

**Horizontal CSA (External Payouts):**
- Involves onboarding and maintaining relationships with multiple external research providers.
- Requires managing payment instructions, bank details, and potential admin fees for each provider.
- Payments may involve foreign exchange, wire fees, and additional compliance checks.

**Summary:**
Vertical CSAs are simpler to administer, while horizontal CSAs require more complex systems and processes to manage external relationships and payments.
