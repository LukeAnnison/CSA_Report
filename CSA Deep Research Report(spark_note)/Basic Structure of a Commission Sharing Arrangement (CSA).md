# Basic Structure of a Commission Sharing Arrangement (CSA)

A Commission Sharing Arrangement (CSA) enables asset managers to split trading commissions into two components: execution fees and research fees (CSA credits or "pot").

**How It Works:**
- When a buy-side client executes a trade with a broker, the total commission is divided into an execution fee and a research fee.
- For example, a broker might charge 7 basis points (bps) for execution and allocate 3 bps into a research credit account for the client.
- These research credits accumulate in a "commission pot" on the broker's books, representing the client's budget for research.
- The client periodically instructs the broker to pay out these credits to specific research providers, either the broker's own research department (internal) or third-party research firms (external).
- The credits are not held in a formal escrow account but as a liability on the broker's balance sheet until paid out, introducing some counterparty risk.

**Summary:**
The CSA structure allows clients to direct a portion of their trading commissions to pay for research, providing flexibility and transparency in how research is funded and consumed.
