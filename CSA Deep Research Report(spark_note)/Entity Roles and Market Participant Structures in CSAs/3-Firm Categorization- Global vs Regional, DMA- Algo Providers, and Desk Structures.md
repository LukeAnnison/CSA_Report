# Firm Categorization: Global vs Regional, DMA/Algo Providers, and Desk Structures

The CSA landscape features a variety of firm types, each with different operational models and client expectations:

## Global vs Regional Brokers
- **Global Brokers:** Large, multi-national firms with formal CSA programs and dedicated teams. They set industry standards for operational rigor and client service.
- **Regional/Boutique Brokers:** Smaller, often specialized firms (e.g., small-cap specialists) that may implement CSAs on a more ad-hoc basis. Increasingly expected to match the operational standards of larger peers post-regulation.

## DMA/Algo Execution Providers
- Historically focused on low-touch, technical execution, often outside the CSA scope.
- Many now add CSA services to attract institutional clients, sometimes partnering with research aggregators to facilitate research payments.

## Desk Structures: Sales-Traders vs Electronic Desks
- **Sales-Traders:** High-touch, client-facing, often discuss CSA balances and research needs directly with portfolio managers.
- **Electronic Desks:** Low-touch, automate execution and funnel commissions to CSA pots with minimal client interaction.

Understanding these distinctions helps firms benchmark their own CSA offerings and anticipate client expectations.
