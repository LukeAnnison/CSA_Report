# Scope and Jurisdictional Differences: UK, EU, US

The regulatory landscape for research payments and CSAs varies significantly across the UK, EU, and US, creating practical challenges for firms operating internationally.

**UK:**
- As of August 2024, UK MiFID investment firms can use the new joint payment/CSA option, with requirements for budgeting, client disclosure, and reasonable charges.
- Some UK fund management entities (e.g., UCITS managers, AIFMs) are initially excluded but expected to be included later.
- UK brokers can offer CSAs but are not compelled to; it remains a commercial decision.
- The FCA removed prior inducement rule exemptions for small-cap research, as the new framework supersedes them.

**EU:**
- MiFID II unbundling remains in force. Since 2021, research on small/mid-cap issuers (≤ €1 billion market cap) can be provided bundled or free as a minor non-monetary benefit, but full CSA-style bundling for general equity research is not allowed unless using an RPA structure.
- EU asset managers must pay for research from P&L or use RPAs, which are stricter than CSAs.
- UK brokers dealing with EU clients must still accommodate MiFID II rules, meaning EU managers cannot simply opt into the UK's new model.

**US:**
- The US never adopted MiFID-style unbundling. Soft dollar arrangements under Section 28(e) remain legal and common.
- US managers can participate in CSAs (often called CCAs) without regulatory barriers.
- The main consideration for UK firms is the SEC's rule that brokers receiving hard-dollar payments for research may need to register as investment advisers.

**Practical Implications:**
- Firms operating across these regions must maintain parallel systems and policies, depending on client location and regulatory status.
- The UK's new rules realign it with the US, while the EU remains more restrictive, leading to different buy-side behaviors and operational complexity for sell-side firms.
