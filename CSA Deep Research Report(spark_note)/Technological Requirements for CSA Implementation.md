# Technological Requirements for CSA Implementation

Implementing a CSA program requires robust technology and data management systems to ensure accuracy, transparency, and compliance.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Trade Capture and Allocation:** Trading systems must tag trades with commission split information, recording how much is earmarked for research vs. execution.
- **CSA Ledger & Reporting:** Maintain a sub-account per client showing credits, debits, and balances, with real-time or daily reconciliation and reporting dashboards.
- **Payment Workflow:** Manage payment instructions from clients, validate against available credits, and route to accounts payable for disbursement, with controls to prevent overpayment.
- **Tracking Research Entitlements:** Track which clients are entitled to receive research and correlate consumption with credits spent.
- **Integration:** Connect with OMS/trading platforms, finance systems, client portals, and vendor APIs for seamless data flow.
- **Security and Controls:** Implement access controls, confidentiality measures, and audit trails to protect sensitive data and client information.

**Summary:**
A successful CSA program depends on integrated, automated systems that can scale with client and provider complexity while maintaining strong controls.
