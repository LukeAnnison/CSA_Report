# Ongoing Management, Controls, and Governance Reporting

Sustaining a CSA program requires vigilant ongoing management, robust controls, and regular governance reporting.

## Ongoing Management
- Monthly reconciliation of CSA balances and trading records.
- Payment audits to ensure only eligible research providers are paid.
- Client budget monitoring and alerts for approaching limits.
- Collect feedback from clients and internal users to refine processes.

## Controls
- Compliance reviews of payments and research consumption.
- Segregation of duties and access controls in systems.
- Regular audits and documentation for regulatory review.

## Governance Reporting
- Periodic review of key metrics (e.g., number of CSA clients, credit allocations, payout distribution).
- Reporting of incidents, client complaints, and compliance issues to the steering or research payment committee.
