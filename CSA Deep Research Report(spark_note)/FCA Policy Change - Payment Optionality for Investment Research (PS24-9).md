# FCA Policy Change: Payment Optionality for Investment Research (PS24/9)

In response to the challenges created by MiFID II and the evolving global landscape, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced a new "joint payment" option for investment research, effective 1 August 2024 (Policy Statement PS24/9).

**Key Features:**
- The new rule allows UK asset managers to pay for research via trading commissions, essentially reviving Commission Sharing Arrangement (CSA)-style bundling, but with strict transparency requirements.
- The FCA does not permit a full return to pre-MiFID bundling. Instead, the new rules require a separately identifiable research charge within a bundled commission, mirroring a classic CSA structure.
- When an asset manager trades with a broker, part of the commission can be designated for research (the "research charge") and the rest for execution. The research component must be identified and managed separately, preventing the opacity of prices that full bundling created.
- The FCA's approach is designed to preserve cost transparency and discipline, ensuring that research costs are clear and comparable across providers.

**Practical Implications:**
- UK asset managers now have a third payment option for research: from P&L, via RPA, or via the new joint payment/CSA mechanism.
- The change is expected to boost competition, especially for smaller managers who found RPAs burdensome, and to improve the international competitiveness of UK firms by aligning with US practices.
- The new rules also help resolve the transatlantic mismatch that arose after the expiration of the SEC's no-action relief in the US, making it easier for UK managers to pay US brokers for research using trading commissions.

**Summary:**
The FCA's PS24/9 policy reintroduces CSA-style payments in the UK with modern transparency guardrails, aiming to revitalize research coverage and market competitiveness while maintaining investor protection.
