# Termination, Withdrawal, and Amendment Clauses

CSA agreements include provisions for ending or modifying the arrangement, ensuring flexibility and legal certainty for both parties.

## Termination
- Either party may terminate the CSA with a specified notice period (e.g., 30 or 60 days, typically by written notice).
- Termination may also occur if the underlying broker-client relationship ends or if a research provider participation letter is withdrawn.

## Withdrawal
- Participation letters with third-party research providers can be terminated by mutual agreement or if the main CSA agreement ends.
- Upon withdrawal, the broker stops making payments to the provider and informs the client to choose alternate arrangements.

## Amendment
- Amendments to the CSA must usually be made in writing and agreed by both parties.
- Standard contract boilerplate may require written notice and mutual consent for changes.

## Regulatory Change
- Most CSAs include a clause allowing amendment or termination if regulations change, making the arrangement unviable or requiring modification.
- This ensures ongoing compliance and protects both parties from unforeseen legal risks.
