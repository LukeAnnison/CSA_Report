# Key Rights, Duties, and Protections for Broker and Client

A well-structured CSA agreement clearly sets out the rights, duties, and protections for both the broker and the client.

## Broker Rights and Duties
- **Payment Mechanics:** Broker disburses research credits only upon client instruction; not liable for payments absent such instructions.
- **Fee Structure:** May reserve the right to charge admin fees (if disclosed) or offset unpaid execution fees from the CSA pot.
- **Termination Rights:** Can terminate or suspend the CSA with notice, as specified in the agreement.
- **Audit and Record-Keeping:** Must maintain accurate records and may be subject to audit by the client.

## Client Rights and Duties
- **Instruction Authority:** Client directs how research credits are allocated and to whom payments are made.
- **Representations:** May be required to confirm authority to enter the agreement, use client commission money, and that research payments provide value.
- **Indemnities:** May indemnify the broker against claims arising from improper instructions or legal challenges.
- **Audit Rights:** May have the right to audit the broker's records of their CSA account.

## Protections and Risk Mitigation
- **Counterparty Risk:** Some CSAs may include trust language or operational mitigations (e.g., prompt payment) to address risk, though legal trust status is rare.
- **No Influence Clause:** Agreement should state that research payments do not influence execution quality or order routing, preserving best execution duties.
- **Termination for Regulatory Change:** Allows amendment or termination if regulations change.
