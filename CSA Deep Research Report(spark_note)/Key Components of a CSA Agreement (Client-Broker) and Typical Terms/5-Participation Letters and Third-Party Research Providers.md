# Participation Letters and Third-Party Research Providers

Participation letters are agreements between brokers and third-party research providers, enabling the broker to pay out CSA credits on the client's instruction.

## Role of Participation Letters
- Formalize the relationship between the broker and external research providers.
- Set out payment mechanics, invoicing requirements, and timing (e.g., monthly or quarterly payments).
- Clarify that the broker is not liable for unpaid amounts beyond the CSA pot and that payments are only made upon client instruction.

## Key Terms and Representations
- Provider must confirm that the research qualifies under relevant regulations (e.g., MiFID II, Section 28(e)).
- Provider agrees not to influence trading or induce the manager to direct trades for payment.
- Payment terms may specify that the provider is responsible for taxes (e.g., VAT) and that payments are inclusive of taxes.
- Termination provisions align with the main CSA agreement or mutual agreement between broker and provider.

## Compliance and Record-Keeping
- Participation letters support regulatory compliance by ensuring only eligible research is paid for.
- Providers may be required to send invoices or statements for recordkeeping and audit purposes.
