# Templates, Industry Standards, and Best Practices

Industry standards and best practices help ensure CSA agreements are robust, compliant, and efficient.

## Use of Templates and Standard Forms
- Many brokers use standard CSA forms provided by legal counsel or industry associations (e.g., AFME, EuroIRP).
- Templates typically cover core terms: commission splits, payment mechanics, audit rights, and termination clauses.
- Standard forms are updated periodically to reflect regulatory changes (e.g., FCA PS24/9, MiFID II).

## Industry Guidance
- Industry groups and law firms publish guidance and sample clauses to help firms align with best practices and new regulations.
- Public templates and guides (e.g., EuroIRP, Norton Rose, Ashurst) are valuable resources for compliance and drafting.

## Best Practices
- Regularly review and update CSA agreements to reflect regulatory developments and operational lessons.
- Cross-reference drafts with industry examples to ensure completeness and clarity.
- Include clear definitions, audit rights, and compliance protections.
- Engage legal and compliance teams in the drafting and review process.
