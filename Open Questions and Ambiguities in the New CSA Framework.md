# Open Questions and Ambiguities in the New CSA Framework

While the FCA's new CSA regime provides much-needed flexibility, several open questions and ambiguities remain:

- **EU Response:** It is unclear if the EU will follow the UK's lead in adopting broader CSA mechanisms. Ongoing regulatory divergence could complicate cross-border business for global asset managers.
- **Adoption by Managers:** The extent to which UK asset managers will use the new CSA option is uncertain. Larger firms may continue paying from P&L, while smaller managers may revert to CSAs to conserve resources.
- **Cross-Border Payments:** Handling CSA flows between UK managers and EU or other international research providers raises questions about local regulatory compliance, VAT, and inducement rules.
- **Client Consent:** The FCA has hinted that managers may need to consider client consent or notifications when switching to CSA payments, especially for retail clients. The exact requirements under the new Consumer Duty are still being clarified.

**Summary:**
These unresolved issues highlight the evolving nature of the UK's CSA framework and the need for ongoing regulatory and industry dialogue to address cross-border, operational, and client-facing complexities.
